Let's also assume the star has a radius $R_\\odot$ and has the same period of rotation as the sun, the planet has a radius $R_\\odot/10$, and that the planet speed is such that, if it transits the star at its equator, the center of the planet takes takes 2 hours to travel across the star.  \n",

Firstly, consider a particle traveling in a circle with speed $v$, and radius $r$, viewed edge-on by an observer.  When the particle is at the edge of the circle (from the observer's perspective) it has a maximum radial velocity.  When the particle is at the center of the circle, it has zero radial velocity (all of its motion is tangential to the observer).  Find an expression for the radial velocity, $v_r$, as a function $x$ --- the observed separation of the particle from the center of the circle, as well as $v$ and $r$."
