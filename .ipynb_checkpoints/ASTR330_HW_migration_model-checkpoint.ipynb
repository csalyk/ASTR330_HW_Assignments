    "### 1(a): Large planets open gaps in disks and then become tied to the evolution of the disk (this is known as Type II migration). Thus, if the disk is evolving on the viscous timescale, the planet will also migrate on the viscous timescale. Based on the viscous disk evolution timescale discussed in ASTR 230, write an approximate expression for the radial speed of the migration for a giant planet which has formed a gap (i.e., you should find dr/dt).  Note that it may be a function of distance from the star (r), and a few other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may help to recall that the viscosity, $\\nu$, is itself a function of distance from the star (r) and is often parameterized as $\\nu = \\alpha c H$, where $c$ is the sound speed, $H$ is the scale height of the disk, and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant expressing the strength of the viscosity.  (To matched observed disk lifetimes, $\\alpha$ is believed to be near a value of 0.01).  You may also find it convenient to express the sound speed in another form, namely $c=H\\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the Keplerian angular speed. You can read more about this parameterization here: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ASIC..540..643R/abstract"

Then, at some random time, the gas in the disk instantly disappears and halts migration. If this happens in a huge set of planetary systems, what distribution of semi-major axes might  you expect to observe in planetary systems?  To answer this, either come up with a mathematical solution, or create a python simulation of this scenario to make a histogram of final planet semi-major axes."
